# Select Your Meal

This repository showcases a user interface for selecting meals using React, featuring menu items and a summary of selected food with the total price.

This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Local Development

1. Node version 20 or above
2. npm version 10 or above.

Note: These versions are pinned in the `volta` key in `package.json`.

### Environment Variable

Set the following environment variable in `.env` file:

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
````

### Install Dependencies

```

### Start the Development Server

You can also specify a different port:

Don't forget to update `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` accordingly.
